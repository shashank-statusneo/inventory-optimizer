To execute the tests containing a string in its name we can use the following syntax −

pytest -k <substring> -v

To run the marked tests, we can use the following syntax −

pytest -m <markername> -v

Parameterizing of a test is done to run the test against multiple sets of inputs. We can do this by using the following marker

<!--
@pytest.mark.parametrize
@pytest.mark.parametrize("num, output",[(1,11),(2,22),(3,35),(4,44)])
def test_multiplication_11(num, output):
   assert 11*num == output
-->

<!--
To Skip logging for a test failure
@pytest.mark.xfail -->

<!--
To Skip a test
@pytest.mark.skip -->
